assignments for school in assembly

run `./m <path or name of asm file in src>`

ex. 
+ `./m src/01_math.asm`
+ `./m 01_math.asm`
+ `./m 01_math`

all are valid

###[assignment 1](https://github.com/annacrombie/assembly/blob/master/src/01_math.asm):
+ reads two integers, `a` and `b` and computes `a*b-(a+b)/(a-b)`
